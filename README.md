I made this 2D racing game in my pleasure time for learning game development with Godot. I once published this on Google Play.

For now, I decide to publicise the game along with its assets and source-code.

Sorry for my bad drawing skill :D

### Features
- Procedural terrain generation
- Car boost
- Skin system
- Adjustable background
- In-game economy (coins & store)

### How to install
1. Download the game in Releases page: https://github.com/anhcraft/racing/releases
2. Extract the .zip file. 
3. Run the .exe file.

### How to play
- On desktop: Use [W] to move forward, and press [Space] to boost
- On mobile: there will be buttons on screen

Your goal is to collect many coins as possible.

Each golden coin gains you $2-$7 (The more you run the more money you can obtain)

Each emerald coin values $10.

When your distance increases, the terrain will change dramatically. So be careful!
